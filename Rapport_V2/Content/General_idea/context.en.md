The IUT of Chalons-en-Champagne offers teaching based on **practice**. To this end, classrooms for practical work are made available to students, which are equipped with network equipment.
The various practical courses require the deployment of different **services** adapted to the various needs of the course.
These different services are extensions of those present in the data centre.
In concrete terms, the various services are projected onto the network sockets in front of the switch in each workstation room in a fixed and manual manner.
These services **depend on the promotion and the group** using the room, as well as the **nature** of the workstation.
These services can be, for example, access to a private peer network.
To date, the projection of these services is said to be **static** which means that all cases are manually projected in each room.
This implies a lack of network connections for the projection of additional services in specific cases. In the case of practical work requiring services that are not available in the practical room, services have to be redeployed **manually**, and there are few people who can do this. 
In the case of a practical training session conducted by an external speaker with specific needs, this requires the action of a qualified person, not necessarily available.
