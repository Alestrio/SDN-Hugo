To this end, classrooms are available to students, equipped with network equipment.
Services to deploy The different practical courses require the deployment of different services adapted to the different needs of the practical course. These different services are extensions of those present in the Data-Center. In concrete terms, these services are projected onto the network sockets in front of the switch in each workstation room in a fixed and manual way.</description></item><item><title>Expectations of the project</title><link>/rapport/content/general_idea/expectations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 17:35:34 +0200</pubDate><guid>/rapport/content/general_idea/expectations/</guid><description>The project consists in developing a tool to manage the projection of services in the classrooms. This tool, preferably on a mobile platform, will be accessible by all persons having access to the IUT network via the VPN tunnel service already in place.
It will also be possible to place a QR code access in the classrooms, in order to facilitate access to the service. Changing the topology should be quick and easy.</description></item></channel></rss>
