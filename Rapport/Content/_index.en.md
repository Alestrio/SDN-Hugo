The **SDN** or **Software Defined Network** is a concept whose goal is to create or modify a network infrastructure in a software way.
This concept is one of the subjects of project which were proposed to us by the IUT of Ch√¢lons-en-Champagne, within the second year project of Technical Degree in Networks and Telecommunications.
We chose this subject because it is very formative and opens perspectives of acquisition of competences in a very broad spectrum, very useful for the development of a professional project. This project also allowed us to develop skills in programming, supervision, project management and networks. We hope to be able to use these skills in our future careers.

On next generation assets, the SDN concept is integrated in the operating systems of the network devices, in the form of a **communication interface**, based on standard communication technologies (HTTP).
This interface, called **API** for Application programming Interface, allows the configuration of devices by sending HTTP requests to the API, i.e. requests similar to those used by a web browser.
The old generation assets in production in the practical work rooms at the IUT do not have this interface. It is therefore necessary to **create a communication interface** for these network devices.

This observation leads us to the following problem: __How to easily adapt the configuration of the network assets in the classrooms?__

We will start by explaining some **generalities** about the project, then we will talk more generally about the **functional breakdown** of our application. We will then move on to two more technical parts concerning the **realization** of the project and its implementation in **production**.
