#### ACCESS

The access mode is a port configuration mode on Cisco equipment that is used for connecting devices (computer, printer ...).

#### API

API means **Application Programming Interface**, an API is in fact a service that exposes configuration and data retrieval procedures, through configurable URLs.

#### CI/CD

CI/CD stands for **continuous integration / continuous deployment**. It is a process that allows to automatically publish on a server the progress of a project when it is considered acceptable. In our case we use it to publish the updates of the application as well as to publish our project report.

#### DOCKER

Docker is a software that allows to build, run and manage containers on servers or directly in the cloud. Containers are files or sets of files that define an application that can be executed by the Docker service. Concretely, a container is an isolated execution environment for an application.

#### GIT

Git is a version control system. It is a system that allows collaborative work, it allows to work on files and to make the whole common by avoiding the problems of version and conflicts.

#### GITHUB

Github is an online application, based on git, it allows project management, but also idea sharing for public projects. We use in our case Github to host the project files and also deploy them on the IUT servers with the CI/CD.

#### JSON

JSON stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**, it is a file format widely used in the development world, especially for writing configuration files.

#### DEVICE PARK

The device park of a network is the set of network devices that are in production on a network.

#### CONSOLE PORT

The console port is a physical port dedicated to the configuration of a network asset.

#### SNMP

SNMP stands for **Simple Network Management Protocol**. It is a protocol that allows different devices on a network to share information. It is particularly useful, because it allows devices of different natures (switch and router for example) and different versions to communicate.

#### SSH

SSH stands for **Secure SHell**. SSH is a secure communication service, which means that the information transmitted through the network is encrypted.

#### TCP

TCP stands for **Transmission Control Protocol**. TCP is a standard information transport protocol on a network. It is used to ensure that all data is transmitted during a communication.

#### TELNET

TELNET stands for **TELecommunication NETwork**. TELNET is a protocol similar to SSH, but it is not secure, allowing information to be transmitted freely over the network.

#### TRUNK

TRUNK is one of the two modes that the ports of a network asset can take. It is used in the case where several vlans must circulate at the same place through the same port.

#### UDP

UDP stands for **User Datagram Protocol**. UDP is a transport mode similar to TCP, however it does not ensure the correct reception of transmitted data.

#### VLAN

VLAN means **Virtual LAN**. It is a virtual sub-network that allows to group different equipments inside a "switching unit", it is the equivalent of a black box, it allows to group equipments on a same network.

#### YAML

YAML is a language for ordering data similar to JSON. It is often used for configuration files.
