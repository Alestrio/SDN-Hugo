To begin this project report, we would like to thank our technical tutor **Mr. HUSSENET Laurent** for his support and help throughout the project.
A big thanks also to our tutor **Ms. GOBILLARD Delphine** who helped us organize and prepare the different tests.
We thank more generally all the teaching staff who supported us throughout this project.
Finally, we thank **Alexandre GOSSARD** and **Corentin FREIRE**, with whom we helped each other in the realization of our respective projects. It is thanks to them that we were able to develop an essential skill in the realization of our future projects: the mutual aid beyond the borders of the team.
