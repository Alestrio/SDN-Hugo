To conclude this project report, we can say that the project has been partially successfully completed.
We were able to develop a configuration interface for legacy assets, as well as the web interface to use this configuration interface. \
During this project, we were able to use a lot of technologies that are now used in production, for large-scale applications.

Personally, we learned a lot from this project. We were able to learn how to use new production technologies (containerization, Traefik, automatic deployment, etc.).
We were also able to consolidate our programming knowledge, through the development of the web interface and the configuration interface (with technologies such as FastAPI, Flask, etc.). \
Finally, thanks to this project, we were able to consolidate our teamwork skills.

We hope to be able to use this knowledge again for future projects!
