The IUT of Chalons-en-Champagne proposes a teaching based on **practice**. To this end, classrooms are available to students, equipped with network equipment.

## Services to deploy

The different practical courses require the deployment of different **services** adapted to the different needs of the practical course.
These different services are extensions of those present in the Data-Center.
In concrete terms, these services are projected onto the network sockets in front of the switch in each workstation room in a fixed and manual way. \
They **depend on the class and the group** using the room, as well as the **nature** of the practical training session and can be, for example, the access to a private binome network.

## The projection of these services to date

Today, the projection of those services is said to be **static** which means that all cases are manually projected in each room.
This way of doing things implies a lack of network connections for the projection of additional services in specific cases. \
In the case of practical work requiring services that are not available in the practical room, services must be redeployed **manually**, and the people able to do this are few. 
In the case of a practical session led by an external speaker with specific needs, it requires the action of a qualified person, not necessarily available.
